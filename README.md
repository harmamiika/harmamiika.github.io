<h1>React-based portfolio site</h1>
<p>- React</p>
<p>- Data from JSON</p>
<p>- Customized from <a href="https://github.com/Dorota1997/react-frontend-dev-portfolio">this</a> great template.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>- Got some experience working with a existing older codebase written by another developer.</p>
<p>- Not a fan of using JQuery with React but decided to go on with it since it doesn't really affect the functionality here.</p>
